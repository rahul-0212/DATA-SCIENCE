📊 Data Science Journey


Welcome to my Data Science Journey repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress, learnings, and projects as I dive deeper into the field of data science. From the basics of statistics and Python to machine learning, deep learning, and real-world projects — it's all here!

🚀 Goals
Build a solid foundation in Python and Statistics

Learn essential Data Analysis and Data Visualization techniques

Master Machine Learning concepts and apply them to real datasets

Explore Deep Learning, NLP, and Time Series Analysis

Contribute to open-source and work on end-to-end projects
